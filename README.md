The platform-specific version of the dynamic library from the 'lib'-folder in the package's root directory is required for distributing the resulting application:
- *libAsposePDFforRust_linux_amd64.so* for Linux x64 platform
- *libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_arm64.dylib* for macOS arm64 platform
- *libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_amd64.dylib* for macOS x86_64 platform
- *AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.dll and AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.lib* for Windows x64 platform.

## Installation

### Installation from Aspose website

This package includes a large file which is stored as a bzip2 archive.

1. **Download** the archive **Aspose.PDF for Rust via C++** from the official Aspose website.
   The latest (most recent) version is listed at the top and is downloaded by default when you click the **Download** button.
   It is recommended to use this latest version. Only download a previous version if needed.
   Example: `Aspose.PDF-for-Rust-via-CPP-25.6.zip`

   The archive filename format is: `Aspose.PDF-for-Rust-via-CPP-YY.M.zip`, where:
   - `YY` = last two digits of the year (e.g., `25` for 2025)
   - `M` = month number from `1` to `12`

2. **Extract** the archive to your chosen directory `{path}` using a suitable tool:
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     unzip Aspose.PDF-for-Rust-via-CPP-YY.M.zip -d {path}
     ```
   - On Windows, use built-in Explorer extraction or any unzip tool (7-Zip, WinRAR).

3. **Add** the library as a dependency in your Rust project. You can do this in two ways:

   - **Using the command line:**
     ```bash
     cargo add asposepdf --path {path}/asposepdf
     ```

   - **Manually editing `Cargo.toml`:**
     Open your project's `Cargo.toml` and add the following under `[dependencies]`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     asposepdf = { path = "{path}/asposepdf" }
     ```

4. **Build** your project (`cargo build`). On the first build, the dynamic library for your platform will be unpacked automatically from the `.bz2` archive in the `lib` folder. This may cause a short delay.

> **Notes**
> - The `lib` folder contains all platform-specific `.bz2` archives with corresponding `.sha256` checksum files.
> - If the checksum file is missing or invalid, the build will fail.
> - Update the library by replacing the extracted files with a newer archive version.

### Installation from GitHub

This package includes precompiled native libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`) which are stored as compressed `.bz2` archives inside the GitHub repository.

1. **Add** the library as a dependency in your Rust project. You can do this in two ways:

   - **Using the command line:**
     ```bash
     cargo add asposepdf --git https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp.git
     ```

   - **Manually editing `Cargo.toml`:**
     Open your project's `Cargo.toml` and add the following under `[dependencies]`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     asposepdf = { git = "https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp.git" }
     ```

		> **Note:** To use a specific release version, you can specify a tag:
		>
		> ```toml
		> asposepdf = { git = "https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp.git", tag = "v1.25.7" }
		> ```

2. **Build** your project (`cargo build`). On the first build, the appropriate dynamic library for your platform will be automatically unpacked from the `.bz2` archive in the `lib` folder. This may cause a short delay.

> **Notes**
> - You do not need to manually download or extract any files — everything is included in the GitHub repository.
> - All `.bz2` archives have matching `.sha256` checksum files. The checksum is verified before unpacking.
> - If the checksum verification fails or the archive is missing, the build will fail with a detailed error.
> - The build script links the appropriate native library and ensures runtime availability using platform-specific options.

### Installation from crates.io

This package is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/asposepdf) and includes a build script that automatically extracts the required native library (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib`) from a compressed `.bz2` archive during the build process.

1. **Add** the library as a dependency in your Rust project. You can do this in two ways:

   - **Using the command line:**
     ```bash
     cargo add asposepdf
     ```

   - **Manually editing `Cargo.toml`:**
     Open your project's `Cargo.toml` and add the following under `[dependencies]`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     asposepdf = "1.25.7"
     ```
	> **Note:** The crates.io package requires you to provide the native dynamic libraries yourself (the .dll, .so, .dylib files).

2. **Set the path** to the directory containing the native libraries and download the required files:

   - **Set the environment variable `ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR`** to point to the folder where you will place the native `.bz2` archives, their `.sha256` checksum files, and the extracted native libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`, and for Windows also `.lib`):

     - On Linux/macOS:
       ```bash
       export ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR=/path/to/lib
       ```

     - On Windows (Command Prompt):
       ```cmd
       set ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR=C:\path\to\lib
       ```

     - On Windows (PowerShell):
       ```powershell
       $env:ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR = "C:\path\to\lib"
       ```

   - **Download the required `.bz2` archives** and checksum files from the GitHub repository's [`lib/` folder](https://github.com/aspose-pdf/aspose-pdf-rust-cpp/tree/main/lib) and **place them** into the folder set in `ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR`:

     - For **Linux x64**, download:
       - `libAsposePDFforRust_linux_amd64.so.bz2`
       - `libAsposePDFforRust_linux_amd64.so.bz2.sha256`

     - For **macOS x86_64**, download:
       - `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_amd64.dylib.bz2`
       - `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_amd64.dylib.bz2.sha256`

     - For **macOS arm64**, download:
       - `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_arm64.dylib.bz2`
       - `libAsposePDFforRust_darwin_arm64.dylib.bz2.sha256`

     - For **Windows x64**, download:
       - `AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.dll.bz2`
       - `AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.dll.bz2.sha256`
       - `AsposePDFforRust_windows_amd64.lib` (native import library, not compressed)

		> **Note:** You need to manually download these files from GitHub and place them into the directory pointed by `ASPOSE_PDF_LIB_DIR`.  
		> The build script will automatically unpack the native libraries from the `.bz2` archives on first build.

3. **Build** your project (`cargo build`). On the first build, the native library matching your platform will be automatically extracted and linked. This step may take a few seconds.

> **Notes**
> - You must provide the folder containing the `.bz2` and `.sha256` files separately, as these binary archives are not distributed via crates.io.
> - If the required archive is missing or the checksum fails, the build will fail with a detailed error.
> - The same binary files used for installation via GitHub or the Aspose website can be reused here.

## Quick Start
All code snippets are contained in the [examples](./examples) folder.

### Hello World!

```rust
use asposepdf::{Document, PageSize};
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Create a new PDF-document
    let pdf = Document::new()?;

    // Add a new page
    pdf.page_add()?;

    // Set the size of the first page to A4
    pdf.page_set_size(1, PageSize::A4)?;

    // Add "Hello World!" text to the first page
    pdf.page_add_text(1, "Hello World!")?;

    // Save the PDF-document as "hello.pdf"
    pdf.save_as("hello.pdf")?;

    println!("Saved PDF-document: hello.pdf");

    Ok(())
}
```

### Save PDF as Office Formats

One of the most popular features of Aspose.PDF for Rust via C++ is to convert PDF documents to other formats without needing to understand the underlying structure of the resultant format.

Give the following snippet a try with your samples:

```rust
use asposepdf::Document;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open a PDF-document with filename
    let pdf = Document::open("sample.pdf")?;

    // Convert and save the previously opened PDF-document as DocX-document
    pdf.save_docx("sample.docx")?;

    Ok(())
}
```
### Extract Text From Whole PDF

```rust
use asposepdf::Document;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open a PDF-document with filename
    let pdf = Document::open("sample.pdf")?;

    // Return the PDF-document contents as plain text
    let txt = pdf.extract_text()?;

    // Print extracted text
    println!("Extracted text:\n{}", txt);

    Ok(())
}
```
